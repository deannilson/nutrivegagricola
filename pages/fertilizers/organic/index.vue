    <h3>What is Organic Fertilizer?</h3>
    <p>
      Organic fertilizers are derived from natural materials such as animal
      manure, compost, and plant or animal products and are a popular choice for
      many gardeners. They work slowly, releasing nutrients over time, and
      contribute to improving soil structure. Organic fertilizers are
      environmentally friendly, and with some knowledge and effort, they can
      even be made at home using compost. They provide a balanced diet of
      nutrients in a form that plants can easily absorb.
    </p>
    <h3>Types of Organic Fertilizers</h3>
    <p>
      Organic fertilizers are derived from plant & vegetable residues, animal
      matter & animal excreta or mineral sources. A basic advantage of organic
      fertilizers is that they have complex biological structure. They take time
      and help of organisms present in soil to break down to simpler nutrient
      molecules. This process is slow and hence the full and timely consumption
      of the nutrients by plants is ensured unlike the chemical fertilizers.

    <h4>1. Animal-Based Organic Fertilizers</h4>
    <div class="pl-4">
      <p>
        Animal manure and slaughterhouse byproducts are the main sources of
        animal-based natural fertilizers. Compared to products made from plants,
        these ones enrich soil with more nitrogen. Hence, they work best for
        growing corn and leafy vegetables. Cow manure has become the go-to
        natural plant feed due to its well-balanced nutritional profile.
        Examples of animal-based organic fertilizers include:
      </p>
      <ul class="ml-3">
        <li>
          <strong>Manure: </strong>It is made from animal excreta(cow dung &
          goat droppings). Cattle Manure is a good source of nitrogen and
          organic carbon while goat manure is rich in nitrogen and potash.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Blood meal: </strong>It s a great source of nitrogen,
          promoting robust foliage development.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bone meal: </strong>It provides plants with calcium and
          phosphorus, which they need for root growth and flowering.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Feather meal: </strong>It is a source of slow-release organic
          nitrogen.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bat guano: </strong>It comprises all the macronutrients and
          has an NPK ratio of around 8–5–1.5.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Poultry (chicken) litter: </strong>It has a high NPK content
          and, in total, contains 13 essential nutrients for plants.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fish meal: </strong> It is a rich source of nutrients,
          especially nitrogen and phosphorus.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fish powder: </strong>It is high in nitrogen while also being
          a source of phosphorus, potassium, and trace elements.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h4>2.⁠ ⁠Plant-Based Organic Fertilizers</h4>
    <div class="pl-4">
      <p>
        Plant-based fertilizing products, often derived from agricultural
        leftovers, might help farm businesses approach more self-sufficiency.
        These fertilizing products decompose relatively quickly and supply crops
        with many important nutrients. If your field is not good in terms of
        drainage and retaining soil moisture, plant-based fertilizing products
        can be a beneficial choice as they encourage soil structure
        improvements.
      </p>
      <p>Here’s a list of popular plant-based organic fertilizers:</p>
      <ul class="ml-3">
        <li>
          <strong>Alfalfa meal or pellets: </strong>It contain large amounts of
          potassium and nitrogen and typically are weed-free.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Corn gluten meal: </strong>It is a slow-release N-fertilizer
          highly beneficial for leafy vegetables.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cottonseed meal: </strong>It provides macro- and
          micronutrients while lowering soil pH.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Soybean meal: </strong>It has a high nitrogen content for an
          organic plant fertilizer, frequently hitting 7%.
        </li>
      </ul>
