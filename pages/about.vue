          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            At {{ $app.name }}, we believe in cultivating a greener future
            through sustainable farming solutions. Founded with a passion for
            organic agriculture and environmental stewardship, our journey began
            with a simple mission: to provide farmers and gardeners with
            natural, effective alternatives to chemical fertilizers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rooted in innovation and guided by nature, we develop high-quality
            organic fertilizers that enrich the soil, protect biodiversity, and
            support healthy crop growth. As a trusted partner in the
            agricultural community, Nutriveg is committed to empowering growers
            with products that are safe for the earth and future generations.
