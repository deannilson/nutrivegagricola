    "desc": "Oats are a nutrient-rich food associated with lower blood cholesterol and reduced risk of human heart disease when consumed regularly. The oat, sometimes called the common oat, is a species of cereal grain grown for its seed, which is known by the same name. Oats appear to have been domesticated as a secondary crop, as their seeds resembled those of other cereals closely enough for them to be included by early cultivators. Studies show that oats and oatmeal have many health benefits. These include weight loss, lower blood sugar levels, and a reduced risk of heart disease. Oats are among the healthiest grains on earth. They're a gluten-free whole grain and a great source of important vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants.",

    "desc": "Maize, also known as corn in North American English, is a tall stout grass that produces cereal grain. It was domesticated by indigenous peoples in southern Mexico about 9,000 years ago from wild teosinte. Native Americans planted it alongside beans and squashes in the Three Sisters polyculture. A medium ear of yellow corn has almost 900 micrograms of antioxidants called lutein and zeaxanthin. A 2018 study suggests that these antioxidants promote healthy vision and eyes. Antioxidants also protect your body from free radicals, molecules that cause chronic inflammation, heart disease and other conditions.",

It's a good source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals, and can be used in various dishes like soups, stews, and breads. Its Scientific name is Hordeum vulgare and is a cereal grain belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). Barley is a major crop grown globally, particularly in temperate climates. They are used in breads, soups, stews, and other dishes and acts as a key ingredient in brewing beer and whiskey and also a common feed grain for livestock. Other Used as a sweetener and in some cultures, roasted barley is steeped in water as a tea. Barley is a good source of fiber, especially the soluble fiber beta-glucan, which can help lower blood sugar and cholesterol levels. It contains various vitamins and minerals, including calcium, zinc, iron, potassium, and phosphorus.",

    "title": "Sorghum",
    "desc": "Sorghum is the world's fifth-most important cereal crop after rice, wheat, maize, and barley.[10] Sorghum is typically an annual, but some cultivars are perennial. It grows in clumps that may reach over 4 metres (13 ft) high. The grain is small, 2 to 4 millimetres (0.08 to 0.2 in) in diameter. Sweet sorghums are cultivars primarily grown for forage, syrup production, and ethanol. They are taller than those grown for grain. Sorghum is a large stout grass that grows up to 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) tall. It has large bushy flowerheads or panicles that provide an edible starchy grain with up to 3,000 seeds in each flowerhead. It grows in warm climates worldwide for food and forage. Sorghum May Protect Against Diabetes and Insulin Resistance.A study from the University of Georgia Neutraceutical Research Libraries showed that sorghum brans with a high phenolic content and high anti-oxidant properties inhibit protein glycation, whereas wheat, rice or oat bran, and low-phenolic sorghum bran did not.",

Soybeans and soy foods may reduce the risk of a range of health problems, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD) and some cancers, as well as improving bone health. Soy is a high-quality protein â€“ one or 2 daily serves of soy products can be beneficial to our health.Soybeans are rich in isoflavones, which experiments have shown to have reproductive toxicities. A Harvard Study linked high consumption of isoflavones to lower sperm counts. For many, soy can be a healthy food, but if you are a man struggling with fertility, it may be worth keeping off the list.",

Fish meal is a good source of protein and other essential nutrients, contributing to healthy growth and disease resistance and Fishmeal is recognized as safe and natural and is an effective feed ingredient for poultry, provided that it is derived from sustainable sources. Also Fishmeal can be produced from fish caught for human consumption (like salmon and tuna) or from fish caught specifically for meal production (like herring, menhaden, and pollack).The process involves heating (\"cooking\"), pre-straining, pressing (or centrifugation), separation of press liquor, oil polishing, evaporation of stickwater, and drying.
